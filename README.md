What is LMLib
----

LMLib is a machine learning library, in fact, it is just my practice codes of machine learning algorithms. So you shouldn't assume that it is a powerful library, but it may help you to understand algorithms of machine learning.
I am **not** check the correctness and robustness of the codes. So if you find some bugs, please **tell me**. Or you just fork the repository, and commit you fixed codes. Help for our cooperation.
